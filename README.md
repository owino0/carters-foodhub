# carters-foodhub
This is a responsive food website built using HTML , CSS &amp; a bit of JAVASCRIPT
The first , and perhaps most important file we will create is index.html , which is the default entry poit for any web application . All of our subsequent work will build on this initial starting point . The file suffix.html refers to HTML ,or Hypertext Markup Language. HTML allows us to format webpages and text in a similar way to how a word processor is  the ability to link between any document tats on the web ,anywhere in the world . This is the "Hypertext" in HTML .
Though HTML is enough to create a simple website , it falls short in the design department . so we will add color , fonts , and elements positioning by adding CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to our HTML files to make them visually dynamic .
Then next we will build on the foundation of HTML,CSS ad version control as we add JAVASCRIPT , servers , and databases to our stack to build interactive web application .
